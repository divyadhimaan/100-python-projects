## Conditional Statements and Logical Operators

### Tips

- Conditional Statements
    - if-else block:
        ```
        if condition:
            do this
        else:
            do this
        ```
    - These if-else statements can be nested as well.
    - if-elif block:
        ```
        if condition1:
            do this
        elif condition2:
            do this 
        else:
            do this
        ```
    - Multiple if statements:
        ```
        if condition1:
            do this
        if condition2:
            do this
        if condition3:
            do this
        ```

- Logical Operators
    - A and B
