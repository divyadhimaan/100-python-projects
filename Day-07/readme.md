## Hangman

### Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to uncover a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. This Python-built rendition of Hangman captures the essence of the traditional game while offering an engaging digital experience.

Upon starting the game, players are presented with a blank line for each letter of the hidden word, along with a drawing of a gallows and an indication of the number of incorrect guesses allowed. Using their keyboard, players must guess letters one at a time to fill in the blanks.

With each correct guess, the corresponding letters are revealed in the word, bringing players closer to solving the puzzle. However, incorrect guesses result in a piece of the hangman being drawn, potentially leading to the player's loss if too many mistakes are made.

To add an element of strategy, players must carefully consider their letter choices, analyzing patterns in the displayed blanks and using their knowledge of common English words to deduce the hidden word. Additionally, players can choose to play against the computer or challenge a friend by taking turns guessing the word.

Hangman in Python provides an entertaining and interactive way to test vocabulary and deduction skills, making it a popular choice for players of all ages. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, Hangman offers hours of fun and excitement as players strive to unravel the mystery word before it's too late.
