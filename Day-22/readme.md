## The Pong Game

Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, attempting to hit a ball back and forth. In this Python implementation of Pong, players use the keyboard to move their paddles up and down, aiming to prevent the ball from passing their side while trying to score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle. The game features simple graphics and intuitive controls, providing a nostalgic gaming experience reminiscent of the original Pong game from the 1970s. It's a fun and addictive game that offers hours of entertainment for players of all ages.
