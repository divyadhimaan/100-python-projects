## Working with variables

### Tips
- Printing to console 

    ```print("Hello, world!"); ```


- Print Modifiers 

    ```print('Hello, \"Divya\"!');```

- Escape Characters
    - \n -  new line
    - \t -  tab space

- String concatenation

    ```print("Hello" + " " + "World")```

- Input to console

    ```input("What is your name?")```

- Comment

    ```# This is a comment```

- Variables
    - Variable naming convention: 
        - Use camel case
        - use underscore
        - alphanumeric characters

    

### Note: 
- Start code at begining of the line to avoid indentation errors.
- Python is loosely typed language
- Make code readable.
