## Snake game

The Snake game is a classic arcade-style challenge where players control a growing serpent navigating through a confined space. In this Python rendition, players guide the snake using arrow keys or alternative inputs, maneuvering it to consume food items while avoiding collisions with its own body and the walls. As the snake consumes food, it lengthens, intensifying the challenge. This version of the game also includes a high score feature, allowing players to compete for the highest score achieved in a single game session. The high score is saved to a file, ensuring that it persists even if the program is rerun. With its simple graphics, addictive gameplay, and the added challenge of achieving and maintaining a high score, this Python version delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of early gaming eras. Whether you're a novice or seasoned player, the Snake game offers endless fun and entertainment
